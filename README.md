## 🎯 React Hooks Implementation

This project demonstrates comprehensive usage of React hooks as specified in the requirements:

| Hook | Use Case 1 | Use Case 2 |
|------|------------|------------|
| **useState** | Store task list state | Toggle task completion status |
| **useEffect** | Sync tasks to localStorage | Load tasks on component mount |
| **useReducer** | Manage complex task list operations | Handle timer state logic |
| **useRef** | Focus input fields automatically | Track timer interval ID |
| **useContext** | Theme context for app-wide theming | Task stats context for analytics |
| **useMemo** | Memoize filtered and sorted tasks | Memoize completion statistics |
| **useCallback** | Optimize add/remove task functions | Control timer operations |
| **useLayoutEffect** | Scroll to latest task smoothly | Handle responsive layout adjustments |
| **Custom Hooks** | useLocalStorage for persistence | usePomodoroTimer for timer logic |
