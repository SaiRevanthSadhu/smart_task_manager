## 🚧 Challenges Faced & Solutions

### 1. **Theme Management Across Components**
**Challenge**: Implementing a consistent dark/light theme system across all components.
**Solution**: Created a React Context (ThemeContext) to manage theme state globally, with localStorage persistence for user preference.

### 2. **Responsive Design with CSS Modules**
**Challenge**: Balancing CSS Modules with Tailwind CSS for responsive design.
**Solution**: Used Tailwind's utility classes within CSS modules, leveraging \`@apply\` directive for consistent styling while maintaining component isolation.

### 3. **Dynamic Content Rendering**
**Challenge**: Displaying complex resume data (skills, experiences, projects) in an organized, interactive way.
**Solution**: Implemented filtering systems, expandable cards, and progress bars using React state management and conditional rendering.

### 4. **Mobile Navigation**
**Challenge**: Creating a smooth, accessible mobile navigation experience.
**Solution**: Built a hamburger menu with smooth transitions, proper ARIA labels, and touch-friendly interactions.

### 5. **Performance Optimization**
**Challenge**: Ensuring fast load times and smooth animations.
**Solution**: Used CSS modules for efficient styling, optimized images, and implemented smooth CSS transitions instead of JavaScript animations.

### 6. **Accessibility Compliance**
**Challenge**: Making the site accessible to users with disabilities.
**Solution**: Added proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation support, focus management, and semantic HTML structure.

## 🎨 Design Decisions

- **Color Scheme**: Professional blue and gray palette with high contrast for readability
- **Typography**: Inter font for modern, clean appearance
- **Layout**: Card-based design with consistent spacing and visual hierarchy
- **Interactions**: Subtle hover effects and smooth transitions for enhanced UX
- **Mobile-First**: Designed for mobile devices first, then enhanced for larger screens
